# MünzScan (CoinScan)
MünzScan is a lightweight desktop application developed during my internship, designed for real-time coin recognition using a webcam. It integrates live image processing with a responsive Python GUI to help users quickly identify and count coins. Built with usability and performance in mind, MünzScan offers a minimal interface and fast recognition workflow, making it ideal for practical, everyday use.
